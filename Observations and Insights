Observations and Insights: 

1. There is a high correlation at 0.84 between mouse weight and the average tumor size for the Capomulin Regimen which proves that the regimen works.
2. After plotting the tumor size over a span of 45 days for mouse B128, you can conclude that the Capomulin regimen does decrease the tumor size by a significant margin.
3. When plotting the final tumor size for the Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin regimens, you can see that the Ramicane regimen is as effective as the Capomulin regimen.
